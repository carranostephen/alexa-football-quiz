In order to create my Alexa Skill Quiz I decided to use an array of questions and
answers to call from in my intents. Having an array of questions allows the program
to call to a specific index in the array and read off the question individually.
The questions and answers in each array corresponded to one another so answers could
be checked respectively. The "footballQuizIntent" told Alexa to call into the 
questions array and read out the first index because count = 0. Also, this intent 
listened for an answer to the question that was called. Inside the "answerIntent",
a variable called answer was created to take in the answer to the question that was 
asked. 

Alexa checks the answers by using an if statement that says if the answer given is equal
to the answer in the answers array at the given index count will be increased 1 in
order to go on to the next question. Also, within the if statement the score is
increased because the answer given was correct in correlation to the answers array.
If the answer is incorrect, the program enters an else statement that only increments
count because incorrect answers shouldn't improve the score. In order to read off the
next question, the answerIntent emits the footballQuizIntent again with the next index.
This would allow the user to be asked the next question and give another answer that
could be checked. This would be repeated until there were no more questions.

Once the variable count reached the length of questions array, Alexa would stop asking
questions because there is no more and call to a different intent called scoreIntent.
This new intent would tell the user their score by saying "Your score is __%". Because
scores can vary, a function called percentScore(score) was created to calculate the
users score for that round. scoreIntent called to the percentScore function because it
returned the percent the user got correct. Since the questions and answers array are 
called to, the user may decide to change the questions and answers to what they want
as long as they change their invoking names and how they start the quiz.
